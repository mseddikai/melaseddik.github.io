Welcome to my academic webpage! I'm a senior researcher at the [Technology Innovation Institute](https://www.tii.ae/) within the AI and Digital Science research center and member of the [Abu Dhabi Stochastics Group](https://wp.nyu.edu/adsg/). Previously, I worked as a machine learning researcher at the Mathematical and Algorithmic Science Lab of Huawei Paris Research Center, where I was member of the Signal and Information Processing team held by [Maxime Guillaud](http://research.mguillaud.net/). Before that, I was a Postdoctoral researcher at [Ecole Polytechnique](https://www.polytechnique.edu/en) hosted by Prof. [Michalis Vazirgiannis](http://www.lix.polytechnique.fr/Labo/Michalis.Vazirgiannis/). I received my Ph.D. in signal and image processing from [Centrale-Sup√©lec](https://www.centralesupelec.fr/), [University of Paris-Saclay](https://www.universite-paris-saclay.fr/en) in 2020, where I was also attached to [CEA](http://www.cea.fr/) (French Atomic Agency). During my Ph.D. I worked on Random Matrix Theory and Machine Learning under the supervision of Prof. [Romain Couillet](https://polaris.imag.fr/romain.couillet/index.html).

Welcome to my academic webpage! I'm a senior researcher in AI at the [Technology Innovation Institute](https://www.tii.ae/) within the AI and Digital Science research center. Previously, I worked as a machine learning researcher at the Mathematical and Algorithmic Science Lab of Huawei Paris Research Center, where I was member of the Signal and Information Processing team held by [Maxime Guillaud](http://research.mguillaud.net/). Before that, I was a Postdoctoral researcher at [Ecole Polytechnique](https://www.polytechnique.edu/en) hosted by Prof. [Michalis Vazirgiannis](http://www.lix.polytechnique.fr/Labo/Michalis.Vazirgiannis/). I received my Ph.D. in signal and image processing from [Centrale-Supélec](https://www.centralesupelec.fr/), [University of Paris-Saclay](https://www.universite-paris-saclay.fr/en) in 2020, where I was also attached to [CEA](http://www.cea.fr/) (French Atomic Agency). During my Ph.D. I worked on Random Matrix Theory and Machine Learning under the supervision of Prof. [Romain Couillet](https://romaincouillet.hebfree.org/).

**Title:** *Random Matrix Theory for AI: From Theory to Practice. [[slides](https://melaseddik.github.io/files/slides/thesis_slides.pdf)] [[manuscript](https://melaseddik.github.io/files/thesis_seddik.pdf)]*

**Abstract:** *The AI era has driven the recent development of new algorithms and methods, often based on elementary principles allowing to handle large amounts of data of large dimensions. However, these large dimensional data impair the behavior of traditional methods that deserve to be revisited under the eye of more elaborate tools and methods. A better understanding of these methods in the bigdata regime indeed induces possibilities of improvements, thereby leading to the development of more efficient algorithms. The Random Matrix framework provides a powerful tool to understand and analyse the behavior of a wide range of ML methods under simple data models (such as the mixture of Gaussians model) in the large dimensional setting. My PhD thesis aims at going beyond the simple models hypothesis, by modelling data as **Lipschitzally transformed Gaussian vectors** which happen to be more appropriate for practical datasets (structured data, images, etc.).*
